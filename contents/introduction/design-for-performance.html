  <h2>Elements of Performance</h2>
  <p>
    The perception of performance is largely determined by four factors: <em>Duration</em>, <em>Responsiveness</em>, <em>Fluency</em> and <em>Tolerance</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>Duration</h3>
  <p>
    Duration is the actual duration that a process takes. This is the element that is often referred to as “performance” in technical discussions. Different magnitudes of duration require different treatments to achieve an optimal perceived performance.
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Terminology</th>
        <th>Duration <br/><i>[Milliseconds]</i></th>
        <th>Response</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Instantaneous</strong></td>
        <td>up to 100ms</td>
        <td>Acknowledge user input within this time frame. Ideally, a visible process towards the completion of the task begins within this time span. (e.g. ???)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Immediate</strong></td>
        <td>500–1000ms</td>
        <td>Answers to simple requests must be completed within this time frame (e.g. opening a new window)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Continuous</strong></td>
        <td>2000–5000ms</td>
        <td>Answers to complex questions must be completed within this time frame (e.g. loading a web page)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Captive</strong></td>
        <td>7000–10000ms</td>
        <td>Users will begin switching tasks at this point. If a process takes longer than this, it should be segmented.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
  <p>
    Responsiveness is the user perceived time it takes the system to respond to user input.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: An empty dialog appearing immediately after a click and then taking a second to populate with content feels faster than the same dialog appearing with a second delay, but fully populated.
  </p>
  <div class="cf nr2 nl2">
    <div class="fl-ns w-50-ns ph2 mb3">
      <a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/rotavoz/1/embed">view on jsbin.com</a>
      <figcaption class="flex bt bw2 b--green-60 pt1">

  <span class="red-60" style="margin-top: 2px">Don't</span>
</figcaption>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Fluency</h3>
  <p>
    Fluency is the user perceived smoothness of a process. It could also be described as a measure for how hard the machine appears to be working. Aim for constant 60 frames per second.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: A stuttering progress indicator gives the impression of lower performance, regardless of the actual duration of the process.
  </p>

      <figcaption class="flex bt bw2 b--green-60 pt1">
  <img class="mr2" src="../images/global/check.svg" alt="">
  <span class="green-70" style="margin-top: 2px">Do</span>
</figcaption>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Tolerance</h3>
  <p>
    Tolerance is a measure of how long the user expects a process to take and at what point they will abandon or cancel the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: The tolerated duration for loading a web page is much longer than for saving a bookmark.

  <h2>Other Influencing Factors</h2>
  <p>
    These factors can also influence the perception of performance:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Perceived task complexity</li>
    <li>Emotional state</li>
    <li>UI complexity and visual noise</li>
    <li>Bias</li>
    <li>Priming</li>
    <li>Trends</li>
    <li>Task frequency, attempts, failures</li>
  </ul>
